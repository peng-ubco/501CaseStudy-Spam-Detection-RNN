# Spam Detection with a RNN using Keras
This notebook was built for the course ENGR 501 -- *Deep learning and reinforcement learning for engineering*, as a sumplementary material of the RNN lectures, to show a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model can be used to distinguish spam from non-spam. The used dataset is the "SMS Spam Collection", which can be found at Kaggle under "https://www.kaggle.com/ishansoni/sms-spam-collection-dataset".
